# Website Chatbot Appliction for Golf Course 

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a chatbot for a golf course website, specifically for the (made up) "Hillside Forest" golf club. The chatbot provides information about the golf course, its features, membership options, and responds to user queries in a professional manner with golf course etiquette in mind. The chatbot is built using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model and is integrated into a web application using the Panel library.

## Features

Professional Interaction: The chatbot greets users and provides information in a professional manner, adhering to golf course etiquette.
Information Provision: It can provide information about the golf course, its features (18 Hole golf course, tennis courts, swimming pool), and membership options (Bronze, Silver, Gold).
Error Handling: If the chatbot does not have specific information, it directs users to the website or the manager's email for further details.
